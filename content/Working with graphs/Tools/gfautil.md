title: gfautils

This tool is developed in [Rust](https://github.com/chfi/rs-gfa-utils). [Another software, in python](https://github.com/ChriKub/gfautils), takes the same name but seems to be not from the initiative of the same team, and seems to not achieve the same functionalities, being more of a library to load GFA's in memory.
