# [How-to-pangenome](https://tharos-ux.github.io/pangenome-notes/)

> [!NOTE]\
> I'm Siegfried Dubois, a first-year PhD student in the INRIA of Rennes, (France), working on pangenome graphs. Key idea of this repo is to share some of my experience about pangenomes (building, comparison, developpment...). Those are not guidelines but traps I fell into, and that I hope by making this I'll help you avoid!

This repo supports github pages [here](https://tharos-ux.github.io/pangenome-notes/) that aims to help to understand pangenome graphs, based upon my experiences:
+ how to build a pangenome graph
+ how to visualize it
+ How to parse and explore it
