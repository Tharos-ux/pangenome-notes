title: Welcome to How-to-pangenome!

---

> [!NOTE] Information
> I'm Siegfried Dubois, a first-year PhD student in the INRIA of Rennes, (France), working on pangenome graphs. Key idea of this repo is to share some of my experience about pangenomes (building, comparison, developpment...). Those are not guidelines but traps I fell into, and that I hope by making this I'll help you avoid!

Some topics I try to cover in those notes:
+ How to [[build]] a pangenome graph
+ How to [[visualize]] it
+ How to [[parse]] and [[explore]] it
