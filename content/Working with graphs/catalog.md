title: Cataloging pangenomic tools
---
> [!NOTE] Information
> With hundred of tools are labelled as 'pangenome graph' or 'variation graph' on github, it is technically impossible to have a complete and comprehensive catalog of tools.

This section will try to cover as much tools as it can, pointing to existing catalogs and more in-depth descriptions of tools when I used them.

Known catalogs or blogs:
+ [Catalog](https://pangenome.github.io/) from the PGGB team

Tools:
+ [[bubblegun]], a bubble and superbubble caller
+ [[gfaffix]], a tool to simplify graphs
+ [[gfapy]], a python library to handle GFA format
+ [[odgi]], a toolkit for pangenomes
+ [[gfagraphs]] (own work) a library to handle GFA format
+ [[pancat]] (own work) a small toolkit for pangenomes
